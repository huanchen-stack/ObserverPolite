TODO
1. now only support https not http 
    see worker.go --> TLS conn
2. retries are naive: 
    if url is malformed, retries makes no sense
    tosing back and force seems trivial
3. where to set last active? before handle task or after
4. close workers if really needed
5. EstablishTLSConnection error handling
6. semaphores are global
7. redirect succeed not implemented (fake a response!)

*. POLITENESS MAY CHANGE DYNAMICALLY
